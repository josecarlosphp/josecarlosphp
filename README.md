# Jos√© Carlos PHP ‚ö°

## üë§ Who I am
A programming enthusiast with a **creative** spirit.

I always liked to build... Developing software allows me to play my favorite game.

Founder of [PrestaImport](https://prestaimport.com/).

## ‚å®Ô∏è What I do
I participate in **e-commerce** projects with PrestaShop, I develop virtual robots and I review old PHP websites.

I analyze problems and design solutions, also participating in their development and implementation.

## üìÅ My experience
Working with PHP since 2003, I have contributed to the development of **hundreds of websites**, each to a greater or lesser extent.

The amount and diversity of problems I have faced in all this time swell my curriculum.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Not just PHP
Although PHP is the basis of my work, I also manage well in other languages and environments, even not only as a programmer.

Electronics, Arduino, computer made music, simple games,...
